Submission for IMC Prosperity 3. Team rank top 200 globally and top 2 in Vietnam

The IMC Prosperity trading competition is a global, remote-first challenge hosted by the proprietary trading firm IMC. It is designed to simulate the fast-paced and complex world of quantitative and algorithmic trading, attracting thousands of student participants from around the globe. The competition is framed within a playful narrative of bringing prosperity to a virtual island archipelago by accumulating "SeaShells," the in-game currency.

Key Aspects of the Competition:
Format: The competition typically runs for about two weeks and is divided into several rounds, each lasting a few days. Participants, who can compete solo or in teams of up to five, are presented with a variety of trading challenges. Success in the competition requires a combination of skills in Python programming, strategic thinking, and data analysis.


Trading Challenges: Each round features two main components:

Algorithmic Trading: Participants develop and submit Python scripts to automatically trade a range of fictional assets that mimic real-world financial instruments like stocks, ETFs, and options. The goal is to create profitable trading strategies based on provided historical data and market dynamics.


Manual Trading: Alongside the algorithmic challenge, each round includes a manual trading problem. These are often brain-teaser-style challenges that involve mathematical optimization, probability, and game theory.
